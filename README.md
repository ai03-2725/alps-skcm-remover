# Alps SKCM Remover Tool

A 3D-printable tool for removing Alps SKCM/SKCL switches from the plate.  
Simply press the tool onto the switch from below, then push the switch out of the plate.  


## Variants

A thick and thin variant is included.  
- Thick - Taller than the switch pins to prevent being poked by them during use.
- Thin - Flush against the switch bottom once inserted.

I personally find that the thick variant works better, but choose based on what suits your needs.


## Usage

1. Desolder and remove the PCB.
2. Insert the tool onto the switch to remove in the orientation shown - tabbed side away from the plate, narrow side towards the plate.
3. Push the tool against the plate.
4. Push the switch through the opening on the tool.


## Print Settings

Print upside-down with the tabbed face towards the bottom.  
The end that faces the plate during use should be printed facing upwards to yield the sharpest edge possible.  
0.4mm line width/0.2mm layer height or finer is recommended.
