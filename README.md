# Alps SKCM Remover Tool

![cover-render](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai03-2725/alps-skcm-remover/main/Images/cover-render.png)

A 3D-printable tool for removing Alps SKCM/SKCL switches from the plate.  
Simply press the tool onto the switch from below, then push the switch out of the plate.  


## Variants

A thick and thin variant is included.  
- Thick - Taller than the switch pins to prevent being poked by them during use.
- Thin - Flush against the switch bottom once inserted.

I personally find that the thick variant works better, but choose based on what suits your needs.


## Usage

1. Desolder and remove the PCB.
2. Insert the tool onto the switch to remove in the orientation shown - tabbed side away from the plate, narrow side towards the plate.

## Print Settings

Print upside-down with the tabbed face towards the bottom.  
The end that faces the plate during use should be printed facing upwards to yield the sharpest edge possible.  
0.4mm line width/0.2mm layer height or finer is recommended.
